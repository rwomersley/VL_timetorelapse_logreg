# VL_timetorelapse_logreg


This file contains a R Markdown script, and the raw data file used to perform an exploratory logistic regression reported in the paper "Immunological factors, but not clinical features, predict visceral leishmaniasis relapse in patients co-infected with HIV" by Takele et al., 2021.

The raw data file contains two sections; one for individuals who relapsed within 12 months of the time of diagnosis, and the other for individuals who did not relapse within the 12 months of the start of the study. 

The script contains data preprocessing and model building and evaluation of a multinomial logistic regression model which uses PD1, CD4 and IFNG data to predict the time to relapse for individuals with Visceral Leishmaniasis.
